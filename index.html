            <h1>Prudence N. Muthee</h1>
            <p>I am a Unity C# game developer with a degree in Computer Science. I began my career in front-end web development before seizing the opportunity to venture into game development, specifically programming. This transition has fueled my passion for making all kinds of games, whether for entertainment, education or to tell a story. I am very grateful to be part of such an incredible and fast-growing industry.</p>

            <p>Train Loop is a hidden clue game where the player must search a train car for clues and solve them before time runs out and the train crashes. 
                This game was made during the 2024 Women's game jam where I was among a team of 7 ladies.
                 The game’s simple mechanics allow players to move left, move right, jump and throwing objects out of the way to uncover hidden clues. 
                 When a clue is found, the player engages in a puzzle to collect it, triggering a time loop that resets the clock for the next clue. 
                 The level is completed once all clues are gathered.

            <p>This is a personal project. It is a web-based and android side-scroller runner game made in Unity.
                In this exhilarating game, players dash through four uniquely themed environments: silent cottages with streetlights, the serene forest filled with lush greenery and sheep, the treacherous desert with its scorching sun and sandy mountains, and the icy tundra featuring frosty paths.

                Each environment offers distinct challenges and obstacles, ensuring a dynamic and engaging experience as players race to achieve the highest scores and unlock new levels.
