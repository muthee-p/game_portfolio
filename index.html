            <h1>Prudence N. Muthee</h1>
            <p>I am a passionate Unity C# game developer with a degree in computer science. I began my career in front-end development before seizing the opportunity to venture into game development, specifically programming. This transition has fueled my passion for the gaming industry.</p>

            <p>The gaming scene in Africa is vibrant and has made significant strides, but I believe there is still much progress to be made, particularly in my home country, Kenya. This potential for growth and development has inspired me to push forward and contribute to the industry. I actively share updates and insights on the Kenyan gaming scene through my TikTok and LinkedIn, showcasing my commitment to advancing our local gaming community and telling our unique stories.</p>
