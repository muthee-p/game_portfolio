            <p>In this exhilarating runner game, players run through four uniquely themed environments: silent cottages with streetlights, the serene forest filled with lush greenery and sheep, the treacherous desert with its scorching sun and sandy mountains, and the icy tundra featuring frosty paths.</p>

            <p>The game is a 2.5D runner game inspired by top platformer titles like<u> Celeste</u> and <u>Hollow Knight</u>, designed to emulate their precise and responsive character movements.</p>
            
            <p> Key features include:</p>

            <p><b> - Coyote Time:</b> Allows the player to jump even shortly after leaving a ground, giving a more forgiving and fluid feel to the movement.
            </p><p><b> - Jump Buffer:</b> Permits a jump input to register just before landing, ensuring the jump still occurs even if the timing isn’t perfect.
            </p><p><b> - Acceleration:</b> Controls how quickly the character reaches top speed, adding a layer of nuance to the movement dynamics.
            </p><p><b> - Unity Physics System:</b> Utilizes Unity's physics engine to handle gravity, collisions, and other physical interactions, ensuring a realistic and consistent gameplay experience.</p>
                
            <p>The game features 2D characters within a 3D environment, creating a sense of depth and immersion. While the main focus of the game was to study the best platformers character movements, I didn’t follow any specific process for choosing the protagonist and enemies. Instead, I selected a character pack that fit my needs, providing four pixel-animated characters that ensured consistency throughout the game.</p>
            <h4>Scaling:</h4><p> Currently the game has an ending, to scale it would be to make the game an endless runner. I would add procedural generation to the environment and obstacles. Additionally, spawn enemies randomly.</p>
        <h3>Mechanics</h3>

            <p><b>1. Movement and Speed Adjustment Base Speed and Speed Modifier:</b> The player's movement speed is determined by a base speed (8 units) plus a speed modifier. The speed modifier can be adjusted dynamically during gameplay.</p>

            </p><p><b>2. Speed Reduction on Collision:</b> The player's speed decreases by 1 unit when colliding with obstacles, but it cannot go below a minimum speed (e.g., 4 units).

            </p><p><b>3. Jump Mechanics Ground Check:</b> Uses raycasting to determine if the player is grounded. Jump Buffer: Allows jumping even if the jump button was pressed slightly before the player landed. Multiple Jumps: Players can perform additional jumps (e.g., double jumps) while in the air.

            </p><p><b>5. Collision Handling Obstacle Collisions:</b> Reduces the player's speed and plays specific sound effects depending on the type of obstacle. Platform Collisions: Increases the player's speed temporarily. Enemy Collisions: Ends the game and plays a specific sound effect.

            </p><p><b>6. Saving and Loading Progress PlayerPrefs:</b> Stores the player's checkpoint, total distance traveled, number of takes, and speed modifier for persistence between sessions.

            </p><p><b>7. Game Over and Restart Game Over Handling:</b> Triggers when the player loses all lives or hits a wall. Displays game over UI and stops movement. Restarting: Resets the player's position and speed, allowing them to continue from the last checkpoint or start from the beginning.

            </p><h4>Enemy Summary</h4>

            <p><b>1. Player Detection and Following Line of Sight:</b> The enemy detects the player if the player is within a specified distance (lineOfSight). Follow Range: The enemy will follow the player if the player's x-position is between startFollow and endFollow. Flying Height: The enemy maintains a specific height (flyingHeight) while moving.

            </p><p><b>2. Movement Speed:</b> The enemy moves towards the player at a base speed, which can be increased temporarily. Acceleration: The enemy's movement is smooth due to acceleration over a specified time (accelerationTime). Ground Check: Ensures that the enemy is grounded using raycasting.

            </p><p><b>3. Attacking Attack Zone:</b> If the player enters the attack zone, the enemy initiates an attack. Attack Animation: Triggers the attacking animation when the enemy starts attacking. Attack Time: Controls the duration of the attack.

            </p><p><b>4. Collisions Obstacle Collisions:</b> The enemy temporarily disables the collider of any obstacle it collides with and re-enables it after a delay.</p>
