                Our studio, as an integral part of the CitSci Africa Association, developed this mobile game for the March 2024 CitSci Africa conference. 
                This project aims to introduce audiences to the fascinating world of citizen science in an engaging and interactive way. Players embark on virtual quests, solve scientific mysteries, and collect data, all while contributing to real-world research. 
                </p>
                
            <p>Citizen science is a collaborative research approach that enlists the public in helping scientists answer important questions. It's basically science for everyone! and Through this game, we hope to inspire a new generation of citizen scientists and demonstrate the impact they can have on scientific discovery and community-driven research.</p>
            <p>The game was developed in Unity over the course of two weeks, with extensive use of the UI Toolkit for responsiveness and animations. 
                The game features: Dr. Zara, an AI-generated character, serves as the guide with an AI-generated voice-over and nine mini-games with 6 different mechanics, each corresponding to one of the ten guiding steps of a citizen science project. 
                </p><h5>The Mini Games mechanics include:</h5>
                <li>Drag and drop - level 1,3,5,9 </li>
                <li>Hidden objects - level 2</li>
                <li>Rotating puzzle - level 4,8</li>
                <li>Counting game - level 6</li>
                <li>Maths and observation game - level 7</li>
                
                <p>I was responsible for the research, layout, mini-games and their mechanics, game design, sourcing images, animations, and programming. The game was played by conference attendees and more so by primary school children who were attending the conference. They also took notes.
            </p>
            <h4>Scaling: </h4>The game can be expanded by adding and gamifying more advanced Citizen Science topics since the current version is beginner friendly covering beginner topics.
