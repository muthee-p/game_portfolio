            <p>Train Loop is a hidden clue game where the player must search a train car for clues and solve them before time runs out and the train crashes. The game’s simple mechanics allow players to move left, move right, jump and throwing objects out of the way to uncover hidden clues. When a clue is found, the player engages in a puzzle to collect it, triggering a time loop that resets the clock for the next clue. The level is completed once all clues are gathered.</p>
            <p>The game is a 2D blend of platformer and Tetris mechanics, developed during the Women's Game Jam in August 2024 with the theme "Time Loop." As part of a 6-member team, my primary responsibility as a programmer was to implement the main gameplay, which involved writing code for both the character movement and the Tetris game elements.</p>

            <p>Our team conceived the idea of a hidden clue game where the player, taking on the role of a cat detective, must search a train car for clues and solve puzzles before time runs out and the train crashes. We chose simple mechanics due to the time constraint as the game needed to be done and uploaded in 4 days. We also chose a cat as the protagonist to create a cute and engaging experience, reflecting our team's shared love for cats.</p>
            <h3>Game Features</h3>
            <p><b>Timeloop - </b>The player must collect all the clues to complete a level while racing against the clock. After each clue is found, the timer loops back, giving the player another chance to find the next clue before time runs out. The player throws objects out of the way as they move around the train compartment, revealing hidden clues. This time-looping cycle continues until all clues are collected, marking the end of the game. </p>
            <p><b>Tetris Puzzle - </b>Once the player found the clue that is hidden behind object the game tasks the player to play a Tetris puzzle game to collect the clue.There is a score target the player needs to reached for it to be considered to win the Tetris game.The puzzle game is on the same timer as the rest of the level and a player needs to reach the score target both find the clue and finish the Tetris game before timer ends.</p>
            <h4>Scaling: </h4> Currently the game has only one level, therefore to expand the game, we'd add more levels with more clues and lesser time to find the clues, adding to the difficulty. We are also looking into make a mobile version playable on the web and android phones.
