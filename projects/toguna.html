            <p>The Sanctuary of Dreams is a metaverse multi-user dream world, fusing Art, music, animation and storytelling to support a Future-dreaming ritual through which participants can envision desirable future scenarios guided by their innermost desires.</p>
            <p>Accessible through the browser or with a VR headset, it takes the form of a digital temple composed of five buildings, built around an open courtyard and nested within a lush, primordial garden. </p>
            <p>According to IFA, the ancient spiritual tradition of the Yoruba people (Nigeria, Benin, Togo etc), in order to achieve a truly satisfying and fulfilling life, one must consider five fundamental pillars: Ce-Meji pertains to the Body, Ka-Ogbe to the Mind, Gbe-Meji to the Spirit, Sa-Meji to the Heart and Yeku-Meji to the Soul. The pillars are introduced through the five buildings, in the format of mixed-media photo, 3D and digital collage animations, each considering the visible and the invisible dimension of their corresponding principle.</p>
